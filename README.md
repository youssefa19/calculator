# Calculator Project
This project aims to develop a calculator using an AVR microcontroller, a keypad, and an LCD display.

# Overview of the Project
The calculator is designed to execute all basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also has the functionality to perform certain programmer-specific operations, such as converting decimal numbers into hexadecimal and binary formats.

Here’s a brief description of the programmer operations that the calculator can handle:

1-Decimal to Hexadecimal (DEC TO HEX): This feature allows the user to convert a decimal number into its corresponding hexadecimal value. The user enters a decimal number via the keypad, and the calculator then displays the hexadecimal equivalent on the LCD screen.

2-Decimal to Binary (DEC TO BIN): This feature enables the user to convert a decimal number into its binary equivalent. The user inputs a decimal number using the keypad, and the calculator then shows the binary equivalent on the LCD display
